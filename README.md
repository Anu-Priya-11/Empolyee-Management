Employee-Management System.

Technology stack:-

1)MySQL Database:A popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for accessing and managing data.

2)Spring Boot 3:A framework for building production-ready applications quickly, providing defaults for code and configuration to rapidly start new Spring projects.

3)Spring Data JPA (Hibernate 6):Spring Data JPA: A part of the larger Spring Data family, it simplifies the implementation of data access layers by reducing boilerplate code.
Hibernate 6: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for Java, used within Spring Data JPA to map Java objects to database tables.

4)IntelliJ IDEA:An integrated development environment (IDE) for Java development, providing comprehensive coding assistance and tools for code navigation, refactoring, and debugging.

5)Maven:A build automation tool used primarily for Java projects, it manages project dependencies, builds, and documentation.

6)Postman Client:A collaboration platform for API development, it allows users to create, test, and document APIs with an intuitive user interface.

MySQL Database:

Use Case: Storing and retrieving application data.
Key Features: Scalability, high performance, reliability, and ease of use.
Integration: Used as the underlying database for persisting data in a Spring Boot application.

Spring Boot 3:

Use Case: Creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
Key Features: Autoconfiguration, standalone configuration, embedded servers (like Tomcat, Jetty), and microservice support.
Integration: Provides the backbone for the application, handling configuration, server setup, and application context management.

Spring Data JPA (Hibernate 6):

Use Case: Simplifying data access layers and providing CRUD operations without boilerplate code.
Key Features: Repositories, JPA-based data access, and integration with Hibernate.
Integration: Spring Data JPA manages the interaction with the database, using Hibernate as the JPA provider to map Java objects to database tables and vice versa.

IntelliJ IDEA:

Use Case: Writing, running, and debugging Java applications.
Key Features: Intelligent code completion, syntax highlighting, code inspections, version control integration, and built-in terminal.
Integration: Provides a robust development environment for building and managing Spring Boot applications.

Maven:

Use Case: Managing project builds, dependencies, and documentation.
Key Features: Project configuration via pom.xml, dependency management, and build lifecycle management.
Integration: Manages the dependencies for Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and other libraries, ensuring the correct versions are used and simplifying the build process.

Postman Client:

Use Case: API development, testing, and documentation.
Key Features: Creating and sending HTTP requests, testing API endpoints, scripting tests, and generating documentation.
Integration: Used for testing REST APIs developed with Spring Boot, ensuring they work as expected and documenting the API endpoints.

Advantages:
It can improve their overall HR efficiency, ensure regulatory compliance, and enhance employee satisfaction and engagement, ultimately contributing to their success and growth.
Monitors and evaluates employee performance through performance appraisals, goal setting, and continuous feedback.
Helps in identifying training needs and creating development plans for employees, leading to a more skilled and motivated workforce.
